        <p class="intro">An Art Director's Club of Metropolitan Washington tradition since 1975, is now presented by George Mason University School of Art.</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>In March 1975, the ADCMW held their first The Real Show.The Real Showwas an annual competition giving college students the opportunity to solve real-life communication design problems. The idea was simple: give “real-world” design problems to local design students for them to solve in their own way. Students take the challenge of real competition, real projects, and real deadlines.</p>
        <p>We invite students to enter the 2023 competition. We want to see your solutions to actual problems that area designers were asked to solve in their professional practice. Entries will be judged by a distinguished jury of local designers and educators.</p>
        <h3>Free Enter</h3>
        <p>To enter, students are to choose one of the problems below and create their solution within the limitations described. Students may collaborate with another student, and enter as many proejcts as they wish.</p>
